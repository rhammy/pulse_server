## üß† Core Concept

Your **server** is the authoritative source of truth.

* It maintains a **global simulation state** (world, entities, positions, velocities, etc.).
* It runs in a **tick loop** (e.g. 60 ticks per second).
* It accepts **client commands** asynchronously (like ‚Äúmove‚Äù, ‚Äújump‚Äù, ‚Äúcast spell‚Äù).
* It applies those commands during the next simulation tick in a **thread-safe** way.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Thread Architecture

Here‚Äôs a good starting division of labor:

**1. Main Simulation Thread**

* Runs at a fixed tick rate.
* Reads queued commands.
* Updates global state deterministically.
* Emits state deltas or events for clients.

**2. Networking Threads (I/O)**

* One thread (or pool) handling socket reads/writes.
* Pushes client messages into a thread-safe queue.
* Pops outgoing messages to send state updates back to clients.

**3. Worker Threads (optional later)**

* For physics calculations, AI, or other heavy workloads.
* Each can work on different parts of the world safely, or through a job system.

## üß© Core Data Flow

```
Clients --> Network Threads --> Command Queue --> Simulation Thread --> State Updates --> Network Threads --> Clients
```

You‚Äôll design synchronization carefully:

* The **command queue** needs to be thread-safe but efficient.
* The **global state** should ideally only be mutated by the simulation thread.
* The **network threads** read from immutable snapshots or delta buffers.

## ‚è± Tick Loop Behavior

Each tick does something like:

1. Gather pending commands from players.
2. Apply them to the world state.
3. Run physics, AI, or systems logic.
4. Prepare outgoing updates for clients.
5. Sleep until the next tick boundary.

You can experiment with different tick rates (30, 60, 120) and see how they impact performance and smoothness.

## üí° Growth Ideas (Once Core Works)

* **Add entity ownership:** each client ‚Äúowns‚Äù a character; others are read-only to them.
* **Snapshot interpolation:** clients receive periodic world states and interpolate between them.
* **Rewind and replay:** deterministic simulation with a fixed timestep can allow rewinding or rollback netcode later.
* **Interest management:** don‚Äôt send all entities to all clients‚Äîonly what‚Äôs nearby.
* **Save/load snapshots:** serialize the world state each tick to test persistence.
